# Business Problem 
_Improving Indigenous Access to Healthcare: A Business Challenge_
Indigenous communities in Canada face significant barriers to accessing primary healthcare, creating systemic challenges that not only impact individual well-being but also drive up government healthcare costs. A systematic review by Barbo et al. (2024) highlighted that Indigenous populations prioritize healthcare that is safe, accessible, and respectful. Despite these priorities, discrimination and racism within the healthcare system remain pervasive, resulting in unmet healthcare needs, poorer health outcomes, and increased reliance on costly emergency and acute care services. The “Health Care Access and Experiences among Indigenous People” report (2024), which surveyed 6,206 individuals, further revealed systemic gaps in accessibility, cultural safety, and equitable treatment. Addressing these issues is crucial not only to improve healthcare outcomes for Indigenous populations but also to reduce the significant financial burden on government resources caused by inefficiencies and systemic barriers.

# Hypothesis



# Project Plan
To ensure the feasibility of the project, a pilot program will be developed.
* Program Duration: The project is designed as a one-year initiative to ensure a thorough and measurable impact within the target communities.
* Sample: A carefully selected sample size will be utilized to ensure the validity and reliability of the findings and outcomes.
* Priority Area: The primary focus of the project will be on enhancing health literacy within Indigenous communities, addressing a critical barrier to healthcare access.
* Hypothesis Testing: The project will involve testing specific hypotheses to evaluate the effectiveness of proposed interventions and strategies.


# Definitions
_Indigenous Health Centers: Financial and Systemic Challenges_
* In Canada, Aboriginal Health Access Centres (AHACs) are community-led organizations that provide primary healthcare services to First Nations, Métis, and Inuit populations. These centers aim **to reduce the physical distance** between Indigenous communities and the healthcare system, helping to address disparities in access to care. Notable examples, such as the First Nations Health Authority in British Columbia, highlight this transition towards Indigenous-led healthcare delivery (Toronto Central Healthline, n.d.)
* However, the construction and operation of these health centers come with **significant financial costs**. High construction and maintenance expenses are often compounded by systemic challenges, including **persistent cultural and communication barriers** that hinder effective service delivery. The government has made efforts to fund healthcare infrastructure in remote areas, but these costs remain a burden on public finances. As highlighted in several reports, such as those from The Globe and Mail and the Canadian government, addressing these financial and systemic challenges is critical for improving healthcare access and equity for Indigenous populations (The Globe and Mail, 2024; Indigenous Services Canada, 2024).
* Given these ongoing issues, it is essential **to implement prompt and strategic changes in healthcare practices**, organizational structures, and policy development to ensure the long-term sustainability of Indigenous health centers and improve healthcare outcomes for these communities.

_The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (TRC)_
* National organization created to address the legacy of residential schools and the broader history of systemic abuse, discrimination, and marginalization experienced by Indigenous peoples in Canada (Indigenous Services Canada, n. d. ).
* In 2022, a call for action to decrease health inequality was refreshed.
* This call for action emphasizes the need for **improved healthcare access and outcomes for Indigenous populations**.

_The Canadian Centre for Caregiving Excellence (CCCE)_
* Indigenous caregivers face unique challenges due to **historical and systemic issues**, which may be addressed through support services and research promoted by the CCCE.
* Integrating **culturally relevant caregiving strategies aligns with the TRC’s recommendations** for improving healthcare for Indigenous peoples.
* The CCCE’s efforts to enhance caregiving practices can involve **developing culturally competent models** that respect Indigenous healing practices and traditional caregiving roles.

_Indigenous Caregivers_
* Indigenous caregivers encounter **unique challenges** resulting from historical and systemic issues **that impact their ability to access healthcare and caregiving support**.
* Efforts should **focus on integrating culturally relevant caregiving models that respect Indigenous healing practices** and align with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) recommendations for improving healthcare for Indigenous peoples (Canadian Caregiving Network, n.d.-b).

_Health Literacy_
* In accordance with Lambert et al. (2014), **health professionals often demonstrate a limited understanding of health literacy and its implications for Indigenous patients**.
* This lack of comprehension, coupled with perceived barriers to enhancing health literacy, **significantly impedes the ability of healthcare providers to effectively support the development of health literacy skills among Indigenous patients**. Consequently, this gap in understanding may restrict patients' ability to fully grasp the nature of their illnesses and the necessary steps to manage their health conditions, further exacerbating the challenges in healthcare access and outcomes for Indigenous communities.
* Addressing this issue is crucial to improving health literacy and ultimately **enhancing the quality of care provided to Indigenous populations**.
* Indigenous populations generally exhibit **lower literacy levels**, with approximately 60% of adults and 88% of older adults lacking adequate health literacy (Chiarelli and Edwards, 2006).
